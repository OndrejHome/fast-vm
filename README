== FAST-VM ==
fast-vm â€” script for defining VMs from images provided in thin LVM pool

fast-vm provides command-line interface to create virtual machines (VMs) in libvirt,
based on imported disks in LVM and XML templates.

Templates of VM disk drives are stored in LVM thinpool LV for space efficiency. Templates
for VMs are just libvirt XMLs with few macros from fast-vm. When creating a VM, fast-vm will
create new writable LVM snapshot of disk drive, define libvirt VM for it and make a static
DHCP reservation for libvirt network on which VM will be.
Optionally fast-vm allows to do some customization of disk drive of new machine before
starting VM using the 'hack files'.

====== Requirements ======
* libvirt with qemu/kvm 
* libxml2 (xmllint)
* LVM thin pool support
* LVM VG with reasonable amount of free space (to create LV with thin pool)
** you can use 'losetup' to create a loopback device with LVM
* preconfigured VM disk images and XML files (downloadable separately)
* 'dhcp_release' for proper DHCP static leases release
* 'flock' for image locking (prevent use of not fully imported images)
* (optional) 'bash-completion' for bash completion to work
* (optional) 'pv' to show import progress
* (optional) 'curl' to pass http(s) link for image_import
* (optional) OVMF EUFI image for UEFI support in images

====== Installation ======
=== From source
## As root
1. Ensure you have all requirements needed (FIXME: have script for checking them)
2. Install using command 'make install'
3. Continue with 'FAST-VM Configuration'

=== From RPM
## As root
1. Install RPM
  # dnf install fast-vm-*.rpm
    or
  # yum install fast-vm-*.rpm
2. Start libvirt service
  # systemctl start libvirtd
2A. (Fedora 24 only) Start virtlogd service
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1290357
  # systemctl start virtlogd
3. Continue with 'FAST-VM Configuration'

====== FAST-VM Configuration ======
## As root user
1. Run 'configure-fast-vm' script and answer questions to configure fast-vm.
Script will:
- create default configuration file from your answers
- create LVM thin pool with name and size of your choice (if it doesn't exist)
- create new libvirt NAT network for VMs

2. Add users that will be using to configured group for fast-vm access (default group is libvirt)

3. When NOT using group 'libvirt' to allow fast-vm access, then check fast-vm.conf(5) man page
for further configuration of libvirt daemon (section FASTVM_GROUP)

====== Supported/Tested OS =====
Distribution    Installation method
- RHEL 7.2	RPM
- CentOS 7.2	RPM
- Fedora 24	RPM
- Gentoo	make install

====== Known bugs/limitation ======
* initial setup requires root
* Gentoo might require user to be in group 'kvm' to use guestfish from hacks files
* VM images are provided separately
  - publicly available images can be found at  https://github.com/OndrejHome/fast-vm-public-images
* using 'dhcp_release' to remove DHCP static reservation is not the cleanest
  way of doing so, but there is no other supported way of doing this through libvirt
  (TODO: make RFE/BUG into libvirt)
* sometimes the VM doesn't get designated IP address because the dnsmasq holds
  the lease for some older MAC address (dhcp_release should be fixing this but
  it's not 100% working solution) - use fast-vm-net-cleanup to fix this issue
* when upgrading from version =< 0.9 run 'fast-vm-net-cleanup' to address DHCP issue

====== FAQ ======
Q: Why is it using LVM?
A: Because LVM provides very reasonable management of block devices and writable snapshots
with thin provisioning.

Q: Why is it not using file-based disk images?
A: It takes much more space.

Q: Why not to use file-based disk images with cow (copy-on-write) image?
A: Because if you change the image, the cow images will get corrupted unless you somehow
re-export them. By using LVM this is not a concern as the LVM is keeping track of changes
and will preserve the changes stuff in snaphost so it is safe to edit base image while having
machines that are based on previous version of the base image.

Q: Why not to use BTRFS cow?
A: BTRFS is not as widely spread as LVM and it is not clear if it would be able to provide same
functionality as LVM. There is possibility that I will look at this in the future.
