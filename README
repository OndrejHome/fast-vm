== FAST-VM ==
'fast-vm' is a script for defining VMs from images provided in thin LVM pool.

fast-vm is taking care of:
- defining the VMs from provided XML in libvirt
- creating thin LV thin snaphost as storage devices for VMs
- making static IP DHCP reservation in libvirt network definition for MAC address of VM

====== Requirements ======
* libvirt with qemu/kvm 
* LVM thin pool support
* LVM VG with reasonable amount of free space (to create LV with thin pool)
* preconfigured VM disk images and XML files (downloadable separately)
** check repository at https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/ofamera/fast-vm-images.git 
* bash completion for bash completion to work
* 'pv' to show import progress
* 'dhcp_release' for proper DHCP static leases release

====== Installation/Setup ======
1. Run script 'setup.sh' and answer questions.
Script will:
- create default configuration file from your answers
- create LVM thin pool with name and size of your choice
- libvirt NAT network for VMs

If you there is any error you can run just part of configuration invoking ./setup-*.sh 
scripts on their own

2. Import some prebuilded VM disk images or use your

fast-vm import_image <rhel_version> </path/to/image.gz> </path/to/vm_template.xml> <path/to/hacks.sh>

rhel_version - usually something like '6.7', '6_7', '7' or '7-test' (used for composing 
               LV name and VM hostname)
/path/to/image.gz - gzipped VM machine drive in the 'raw' format
/path/to/vm_template.xml - XML template for creating libvirt VM, check below 
                           for supported macros

# vm_template.xml macros
VM_NAME - substituted for VM name (VM_prefix+rhel_version+vm_number)
THINPOOL_VG - THINPOOL_VG from configuration
LIBVIRT_NETWORK - LIBVIRT_NETWORK from configuration

====== Usage ======
assuming you have imported the image of rhel 6.7 using following command
  fast-vm import_image 6_7 rhel6.7.img.gz rhel-6.7.xml

#a) To edit the VM image so the other VMs are created from this edited image
  # fast-vm create 6_7 base
    ...
    base image VM created, to start this VM use 'virsh start fastvm-6_7'
    This VM is used for customizing the base image of '6_7' VMs
    All changes you make to this VM would be available in newly created VMs
    of that version, this will not affect already existing VMs of same version

  Here you can for example register your system using subscription manager and
  add you ssh key for easier access to VM later.

#b) To create new VM based on that image run
  # fast-vm create 6_7
    ...
    VM 'fastvm-6_7-113' created

  fast-vm created static IP reservation on 192.168.XX.113 in libvirts DHCP 
  for VMs mac address. You can now run the VM manually from 
  virsh/virt-manager/libvirt.

  You can specify the VM number manually
  # fast-vm create 6_7 77
    ...
    VM 'fastvm-6_7-77' created

#c) To start VM - you need to know only VM number from end
  # fast-vm start 113
  
  If you specify any third parameter you will get connected to serial console
  of the VM just after it starts

  # fast-vm start 113 console

#d) Connect to serial console of VM after the VM is started
  # fast-vm console 113

#e) Delete VM - script will try to stop the VM first
  # fast-vm delete 113

====== Configuration ======
Configuration variables in the  /root/.config/fast-vm/config
VM_PREFIX   - prefix for VM names in libvirt and for thin LV names
THINPOOL_VG - name of VG on which is the thin pool
THINPOOL_LV - name of the thinpool (LV)
LIBVIRT_NETWORK - name of the libvirt network and bridge adapter for NAT networking
SUBNET_NUMBER - the XX in the 192.168.XX.0/24 libvirt network created by setup

====== Known bugs/limitation ======
* script requires root on the machine
* tested on the Gentoo and Fedora 22
* VM images are provided separately
* using 'dhcp_release' to remove DHCP static reservation is not the cleanest
  way of doing so, but there is no other supported way of doing this through libvirt
  (TODO: make RFE/BUG into libvirt)
* BUG: sometimes the VM doesn't get designated IP address because the dnsmasq holds
       the lease for some older MAC address (dhcp_release should be fixing this but
       it's not 100% working solution)
