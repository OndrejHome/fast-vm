.SH DESCRIPTION
fast-vm is provides command-line interface to create virtual machines (VMs) in 
libvirt based on imported disks in LVM and XML templates.

Templates of VM disk drives are stored in LVM thinpool LV for space efficency.
Templates for VM are just libvirt XMLs with few macros from fast-vm.
When creating a VM, fast-vm will create new writable LVM snapshot of disk drive, 
define libvirt VM for it and make a static DHCP reservation for libvirt network 
on which VM will be.
Optionaly fast-vm allows to do some customization of disk drive of new machine
before starting VM using the 'hack files'.

.RB "To start using fast-vm you need to configure it first using command " configure-fast-vm 
.RB "and add users that will fast-vm into " libvirt " system group.
Configuration command will create thinpool LV and libvirt network for you or you can use
existing ones.

Primary use case of fast-vm is creation of scratch VMs on single local machine.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B ImageName
Name of image imported in the fast-vm. It should contain only alpha-numberical characters.
.B ImageName 
is part of the LV name and libvirt machine name.

.TP
.BI "PathToImage " /path/to/image.{gz,xz}
.TP
.BI "PathToImage " http://url/to/image.{gz,xz}
Local path or http/https URL to image file in GZIP or XZ format.

.TP
.BI "PathToLibvirtXML " /path/to/libvirt.xml
Local path to libvirt VM XML template. Check the 
.B TEMPLATE MACROS
for list of supported macros.

.TP 
.BI "PathToHacksFile " /path/to/hacks.sh
Local path to shell script which will be executed after creation of the VM and allows
to access the disk drive of the VM before first running it. 

.TP
.B VmNumber
Number identifying the VM. Currently limited to range 20-220 to allow to be used as last octet of the IP address and leave some space static addresses.

.TP
.I /path/to/custom/script
Local path to script which will be executed as soon as the VM is started and reachable by SSH via its IP address assigned by DHCP.

.SH TEMPLATE MACROS
In the libvirt XML and hack files you variables from 
.BR fast-vm.conf (5)
and another special macros below.

.TP
.B IMAGE_NAME
.RI "Contains value of " ImageName " ."

.TP
.B VM_NUMBER
.RI "Contains value of " VmNumber " ."

.TP
.B VM_NAME
Name of the VM composed from 
.BR "VM_PREFIX IMAGE_NAME VM_NUMBER" .

.SH EXAMPLES
Import local image into fast-vm
.sp
.BI "fast-vm import_image " "6.7 /tmp/centosl6.7.img.gz /tmp/centos-6.3\-7.2.xml /tmp/centos\-7\-hacks.sh"

Create VM from '6.7' image with number 42
.sp
.BI "fast-vm create " "6.7 42"

Start VM number 42 and connect to it's serial console
.sp
.BI "fast-vm start " "42 console"

Start VM number 42 connect to it via SSH as root when SSH to machine is ready
.sp
.BI "fast-vm start " "42 ssh"

Create machine with custom definition and hack file. Start it and after it's SSH connection is ready execute custom script 'test.sh'.
.sp
.BI "fast-vm create " "6.7 42 /tmp/custom\-libvirt.xml /tmp/custom\-hacks.sh"
&& 
.BI "fast-vm start " "42 ssh /tmp/test.sh"
